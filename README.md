### Running Test 
Check out a live demonstration of setting up testing here: [Loom Video Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/700103ecd4be4bbdbd251db1bc9d2f91?sid=eea3ab3f-e1aa-4563-b962-028a8d3a5a4d)

To **setup** the tests:
 1. Click on the tests folder 
 2. Create a new file to test a specific functionality -- preferably bunch tests in the same blueprint of file together.
 3. The naming convention for the test should be (test_what you are testing) for example test_authentification
 3. Run the test by clicking the titration flask icon. You should be able to run the specific file that you want. 
 4. After runing the specific file click on the back-end section to run tests in all back-end files to ensure your code hasnt broken other segments of the app.
